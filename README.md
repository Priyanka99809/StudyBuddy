# StudyBuddy
StudyBuddy is an online platform designed to help students connect with one another and study collaboratively. Built using the Django web framework, StudyBuddy offers a seamless, user-friendly experience that enables students to create chatrooms, join existing ones and exchange messages in real time.

With StudyBuddy, students can find like-minded individuals who are studying the same subject or preparing for the same exam, regardless of their location. They can use the chatroom feature to communicate in real-time, ask and answer questions, and exchange ideas and insights.
